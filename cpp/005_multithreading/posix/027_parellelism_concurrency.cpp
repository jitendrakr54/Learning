// Parallelism vs concurrency
// Parallelism is all about launching multiple threads that executes basically the same code but
// on a different set of data.
// All threads are concrring over the same shared memory, so shared data is read and modified by 
// all threads at the same tme, is concurrency

// The more prallelism we have, better performane. The more concurrencies, worst performance

// eg: Parallelism: Adding nos from array example, Concurrency: Processing mail example
