. Email Address not Email ID
    eg: Can I please have your email Address?
        Can you please read out Mr. Gupta's email Address? -> read out means padhkr bolna
        Let me give you my email Address.

. Email Address: A unique identifier for an email account.
    It has 3 parts:
    . Username
    . @ - at, not at the rate
    . domain name

    eg: The Domain extension is incorrect, it should be .in instead of .com
        I have sent you an email.
        Did you get my email?
        Did you get a chance to go through my email? in formal way
        When did you send the email?
        I haven't received your email yet.
        Let me refresh my inbox once.
        Oh, your email was sitting in my junk folder.
        Let me move it from Junk folder to inbox.
        The email is stuck in the outbox.
        I mistakenly deleted that email.
        I can't find that email now.
        Once you have written the email, please run it by me. (ekbar jab email likh lo to mujhe pdha dena)
        Would you please check your sent folder and tell me which date you sent this mail on?
        I always archive my important emails.
        How often do you empty your deleted folder?
        My emails aren't downoading due to poor internet connectivity.
