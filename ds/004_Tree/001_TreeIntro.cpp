// NOTES:
// 0. Tree is a hierarchical data structure which stores the information in the form of hierarchy.
// 1. Tree is a non-linear data structure compared to arrays, linked lists, stack and queue.
// 2. Tree represents the nodes connected by edges.
// 3. Tree is one of the most powerful and advanced data structures.

// TREE TERMINOLOGIES:
// Root, Parent Node, Child Node, Siblings, Path, Height of Node, Height of Tree, Depth of Node, Degree of Node, Edge.

// TYPES OF TREE WE WILL COVER IN THIS SERIES:
// Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, Splay Tree, N-ary Tree, Tri Structure, 
// Suffix Tree, Huffman Tree, Heap Structure, B Tree, B+ Tree, R Tree, Counted-B Tree, K-D Tree,
// Decision Tree, Markel Tree, Fenwick Tree, Range Tree

// ADVANTAGES OF TREE DATA STRUCTURE:
// 0. Tree reflects structural relationships in the data.
// 1. It is used to represent hierarchies.
// 2. It provides an efficient insertion and searching operations.
// 3. Trees are flexible. It allows to move subtrees around with minimum effort.


// 0. A tree whose nodes can have at most two children is called binary tree.
// 1. As there can only be two children of a node we call them left and right child.

// TYPES OF BINARY TREE:
// 0. FULL BINARY TREE / STRICTLY BINARY TREE
//    Every node must have two children, except the leaf nodes.
// 1. INCOMPLETE BINARY TREE / ALMOST COMPLETE BINARY TREE
//    Every node must have two children's in all levels except second last level and should be filled from left to right.
// 2. COMPLETE BINARY TREE / PERFECT BINARY TREE
//    Every node must have two children's in all the levels (Each level there should be 2^L where L is level)
// 3. LEFT SKEWED BINARY TREE
//    Every node should have only left children.
// 4. RIGHT SKEWED BINARY TREE
//    Every node should have only right children.
