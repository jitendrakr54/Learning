# Shell is a UNIX term for an interface between a user and an operating system service. 
# Shell provides users with an interface and accepts human-readable commands into the system and 
# executes those commands which can run automatically and give the programâ€™s output in a shell script.
# A shell is accessed by a terminal which runs it.

# "#!" is an operator called shebang which directs the script to the interpreter location. 
# So, if we use "#! /bin/sh" the script gets directed to the bourne-shell.

#! /usr/bin/bash

echo "Hello World"
